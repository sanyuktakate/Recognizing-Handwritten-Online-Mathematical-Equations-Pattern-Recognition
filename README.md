# Recognizing-Handwritten-Online-Mathematical-Equations-Pattern-Recognition-

This is a Handwritten Online Mathematical Equation recognizer. 

This system is divided into three parts: classification, segmentation and parsing the mathematical symbols. 

Data:
The dataset is the CHROME dataset 2014 with online handwritten mathematical equaltions. 
Each symbol represented an x,y coordinate and the points were not equidistant from each other. The dataset consists of more than 10, 000 handwritten expressions written by different authors.
